# @brooks/catalog

The shared Brooks data layer for both apps.

- `catalog.json` — a normalized snapshot of the real Brooks US catalog, produced
  by [`tools/harvest`](../../tools/harvest). Products, colorways, prices, per-size
  stock, specs, ratings, and image URLs.
- `types.ts` — the schema both apps program against.
- `constructor.ts` — a live client for Brooks's public Constructor.io search API,
  which (unlike brooksrunning.com itself) is reachable from a mobile client.

Why a snapshot plus a live search API is explained in
[LLP 0002](../../llp/0002-brooks-commerce-api.research.md). Short version:
brooksrunning.com sits behind Akamai Bot Manager, which serves `403` to any
non-browser HTTP client, so an app cannot call its product or cart endpoints
directly. Constructor.io and the Brooks image CDN are both open, so search and
photography stay live.

Regenerate the snapshot with:

```sh
npm --prefix tools/harvest run harvest   # re-harvests via a real browser session
npm --prefix tools/harvest run sync      # copies catalog.json into both apps
```
