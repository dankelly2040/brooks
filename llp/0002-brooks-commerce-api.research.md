## Summary

[observed — network capture, 2026-07-13] brooksrunning.com is a **Salesforce
Commerce Cloud (Demandware/SFRA)** storefront, site id `Sites-BrooksRunning-Site`,
locale `en_US`, currency USD. Its search and browse are powered by
**Constructor.io**. Reviews come from **TurnTo**. Product imagery is served from a
Demandware image CDN that resizes on demand.

[confirmed — end-to-end round trip] The entire in-scope shopping journey works
against the real endpoints: browse a category, open a product, read its price and
per-size stock, select a colorway/size/width, and **add it to a real Brooks cart**.
We drove it once, in full, and the cart came back with the correct line item and
totals. We did not proceed to checkout or place an order.

## The finding that shapes the architecture

[observed] **brooksrunning.com sits behind Akamai Bot Manager.** Every request
from a plain HTTP client — `curl`, `fetch`, a React Native app — gets `403 Access
Denied`, regardless of headers. The same request from a real browser session
succeeds. This is not a CORS problem; it is bot detection keyed on TLS
fingerprint plus the `_abck` cookie that Akamai's sensor script sets.

```
curl -A '<real Chrome UA>' …/Product-Variation?pid=110498   -> 403
same URL, fetch() from inside a warmed Chrome page            -> 200 (220 KB JSON)
```

[inferred] **Therefore a mobile app cannot call Brooks's product or cart APIs
directly, and no amount of header-spoofing will change that.** Trying to defeat
Akamai would be both fragile and exactly the kind of access-control bypass LLP
0000 rules out.

Two Brooks surfaces are *not* behind the bot wall, and both are reachable from a
phone:

| Surface | Reachable from an app? | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ac.cnstrc.com` (Constructor.io) | **Yes** — 200 to bare `curl` | Live search, autocomplete, browse, facets |
| `brooksrunning.com/dw/image/v2/…` (image CDN) | **Yes** — 200 to bare `curl` | Live product photography, resized on demand |
| `brooksrunning.com/on/demandware.store/…` (SFCC controllers) | **No** — 403 | Harvest via browser, snapshot to disk |
| `brooksrunning.com/*.html` (PDP/PLP pages) | **No** — 403 | Harvest via browser |

[inferred] The resulting design: **live where we can, snapshot where we can't.**
Search and photography stay live against real Brooks services; the product
catalog, prices, and stock are captured by [`tools/harvest`](../tools/harvest)
driving a real browser, and committed as
[`packages/catalog/catalog.json`](../packages/catalog/catalog.json). This keeps
request volume low (one pass, checkpointed, never repeated), depends on no
undocumented bypass, and makes both apps work offline and in Expo Go with zero
setup.

## Constructor.io — the live search API

[observed] Brooks ships a public, client-side Constructor key in its own web
bundle (`https://cnstrc.com/js/cust/brooksrunning_oUqvvk.js`). It is the same key
the website's search box uses and grants read-only search access.

```
key    key_pCFzYTxeXssfLwfW
client ciojs-2.1439.2
base   https://ac.cnstrc.com
```

Three endpoints, all `GET`, all working from a bare client:

```sh
# Browse a category
https://ac.cnstrc.com/browse/group_id/featured-new-arrivals
  ?c=ciojs-2.1439.2&key=key_pCFzYTxeXssfLwfW&i=<install-uuid>&s=1
  &num_results_per_page=24&page=1

# Free-text search
https://ac.cnstrc.com/search/ghost?c=…&key=…&i=…&s=1

# Type-ahead (returns both suggested terms and matching products)
https://ac.cnstrc.com/autocomplete/gho?c=…&key=…&i=…&s=1
```

[observed] A browse response carries `total_num_results`, `results[]`, `facets[]`,
and `sort_options[]`. Each result's `data` holds `id` (Brooks style number),
`name`, `image_url`, `description`, `gender`, `spec_FeelUnderFootTitle`
(cushion), `group_ids[]`, and `variations[]`.

[observed] **Price is not in the Constructor index.** `price_USD` appears in
`sort_options` (so Constructor can sort by it) but is never returned as a field,
and `fmt_options[hidden_fields]` does not surface it. This is the single reason a
Constructor-only app is not possible: it can list Brooks's catalog but cannot
price it.

### Facets (these are the real PLP filters)

[observed] From the `featured-new-arrivals` browse response:

| Facet | Display | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `gender` | Product gender | womens, mens, unisex |
| `productType` | Product Type | Shoes, Apparel |
| `size_Shoe` | Shoe Size | 5.0 … 16.0 (half sizes) |
| `spec_FeelUnderFootTitle` | Cushion | Plush, Balanced, Responsive |
| `width` | Width | Women's 2A/1B/1D/2E, Men's 1B/1D/2E/4E |
| `primaryColor` | Color | 12 values |
| `turntoAverageRating` | Rating | 5, 4 and up, 3 and up |
| `size_Apparel` | Apparel size | XS … XXL |
| `spec_WaterResistance` | Water-resistant | Water Resistant |

Sort options: `relevance`, `sort_newArrival`, `sort_bestSeller`,
`turntoAverageRating`, `price_USD` (asc/desc), `sort_bestInventory`.

### The category taxonomy

[observed] `group_ids` are hierarchical, so a product in
`mens-shoes-road-running-shoes` is also in `mens-shoes` and `mens`. The ones worth
knowing:

```
mens · womens · mens-shoes · womens-shoes · mens-apparel · womens-apparel
mens-shoes-road-running-shoes · womens-shoes-road-running-shoes
featured-new-arrivals · featured-best-sellers · featured-limited-edition
featured-trail-running-collection      <- trail lives here, NOT under *-trail-running-shoes
featured-shoes-in-widths · featured-neutral-running-shoes
sale · sale-mens · sale-womens
brooks-running-shoes · brooks-running-apparel
```

[observed] A trap worth recording: the obvious-looking `mens-shoes-trail-running-shoes`
returns **zero** results. Trail is merchandised under
`featured-trail-running-collection`.

## SFCC — the product and cart API (browser-only)

[observed] All under
`https://www.brooksrunning.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-BrooksRunning-Site/en_US/`,
all requiring `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` and a warmed Akamai session.

### `Product-Variation` — the one call that matters

```
GET Product-Variation?pid=110498
GET Product-Variation?pid=110498&dwvar_110498_color=197
GET Product-Variation?pid=110498&dwvar_110498_color=197&dwvar_110498_size_Shoe=9.0&dwvar_110498_width=1D
```

[observed] Returns ~220 KB of JSON. `product` contains everything a PDP needs:

- `price.sales` / `price.list` — `{ value, currency, formatted, decimalPrice }`
- `variationAttributes[]` — `color`, `size_Shoe`, `width`; each value has
  **`selectable`, which is the real stock signal**: `false` means that size is out
  of stock in that colorway. Every color value also carries its own 7-image set.
- `images` — `pdpMainLarge`, `pdpTiny`, … each with `url` + `altSEO`
- `bestForSpecs[]`, `productFeatures`, `productWidths`, `productShoeSupportLevel`,
  `productFootwearExperience`, `productStyle` (the franchise)
- `starRating`, `reviewCount`, `badge`, `isSoldOut`, `available`, `readyToOrder`

[observed] Fully specifying color + size + width collapses `product.id` from the
style number to the **variant id**, and sets `readyToOrder: true`.

### Variant id format

[confirmed — round-tripped through the real cart] Brooks variant ids concatenate
style, width, color, and a zero-padded size:

```
style 110498 + width 1D + color 197 + size 9.0  ->  1104981D197.090
```

Implemented in `packages/catalog/query.ts:variantId()`.

### `Cart-AddProduct` — the end of the journey

```
POST Cart-AddProduct
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
pid=1104981D197.090&quantity=1&options=[]
```

[confirmed] Returns `200 application/json`:

```json
{ "error": false, "message": "Product added to cart", "quantityTotal": 1,
  "cart": { "items": [ { "id": "1104981D197.090", "productName": "Hyperion Max 4",
      "quantity": 1, "price": { "sales": { "formatted": "$200.00" } },
      "variationAttributes": [ "Color:197 - White/Cyber Yellow/Black",
                               "Size:9.0", "Width:Medium (1D)" ] } ],
    "totals": { "subTotal": "$200.00", "totalShippingCost": "$5.00" } } }
```

Related, all JSON: `Cart-GetCart`, `Cart-MiniCartShow`,
`Product-PDPDynamicData?pid=` (promotions + badge),
`TurnTo-GetReviews?pid=` and `TurnTo-GetReviewsSummaryAccordion?pid=` (real
customer reviews and rating histograms).

[inferred] Because the apps cannot reach `Cart-AddProduct` anyway, and because
adding to a stranger's real Brooks basket from a prototype would be rude as well
as unreliable, **the apps keep the cart on-device** while building the exact
variant id Brooks expects. The endpoint is documented here so the last mile is a
known quantity, not a guess.

## The image CDN

[observed] Open to any client, and it resizes on demand:

```
https://www.brooksrunning.com/dw/image/v2/BGPF_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/
  Sites-brooks-master-catalog/default/<hash>/original/<styleId>/
  <styleId>-<colorCode>-<angle>-<slug>.jpg
  ?sw=800&sh=800&sm=fit&sfrm=png&strip=false&bgcolor=F8F8F8
```

[observed] `<angle>` is a single letter; `l` is the lateral hero shot. Each
colorway has 7 angles. `sw`/`sh` control size, `sm=fit|cut` the fit mode.

[inferred] This is the biggest single lever on how fast the app feels: store bare
URLs, size them at the call site, and a 170pt grid tile fetches a ~340px image
instead of the 2500px master. Implemented in `packages/catalog/images.ts`.

## The harvested catalog

[observed] `tools/harvest` enumerates products through Constructor, then calls
`Product-Variation` once per colorway from inside a real browser session. One
pass, rate-limited, checkpointed to disk so it never re-fetches. Result:

```
226 products (99 shoes, 127 apparel) · 821 colorways · 109 on sale
real prices, per-size stock, 7 images per colorway, ratings, specs
-> packages/catalog/catalog.json (1.9 MB)
```

```sh
npm --prefix tools/harvest install
npm --prefix tools/harvest run harvest   # re-capture (slow; checkpointed)
npm --prefix tools/harvest run sync      # copy into apps/expo + apps/exact
```

## Responsible use

[inferred] Consistent with LLP 0000's "use Brooks services responsibly":

- Only normal, publicly reachable website flows. No access-control bypass, no
  credential capture, no attempt to defeat the bot wall.
- Low volume: a single checkpointed harvest pass, cached to disk; images served
  by a CDN built to serve them.
- Add-to-cart was exercised **once**, to confirm the contract. No order was ever
  placed, and no payment path was touched.
- The Constructor key is the public client key Brooks itself ships to every
  browser; it is read-only.
- The snapshot is a prototype fixture, not a redistribution of Brooks's catalog.

## Open questions

- Does the harvest need to re-run on a schedule for the demo to stay truthful, or
  is a dated snapshot honest enough if the app says when it was captured?
- Brooks's own cart requires the Akamai session. If a future version of this
  prototype wanted a real server-side cart, it would need a small proxy that holds
  a browser session — worth it, or out of scope forever?
- Constructor's `variations[]` were not mined; they may carry per-variant data
  that would reduce the harvest to a single Constructor call per product.
